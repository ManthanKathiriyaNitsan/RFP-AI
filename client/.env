# Point frontend to RFP-AI backend. Use the backend's network URL so every device (your PC and colleagues) hits the same server.
# - When only you use the app on the same machine: http://localhost:8000
# - When others open the app from their PCs: use the host that runs the backend, e.g. http://192.168.0.118:8000
#   (otherwise their browser would call their own "localhost:8000" and get 401 / connection errors).
