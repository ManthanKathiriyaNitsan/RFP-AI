# RFP-AI backend URL for auth/proposals/etc. Use the machine's IP (not localhost) when others access the app from their browsers.
# Example: if frontend is at http://192.168.0.119:5001, set http://192.168.0.119:8000 so all devices hit the same backend.
# Backend CORS_ORIGINS must include the URL you open the app in (e.g. http://localhost:5001 or http://192.168.0.119:5001).
# Note: Admin user management (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/users) uses same origin, or VITE_RFPSUITE_SERVER_URL when set.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.119:8000

# When the app is opened from a different port (e.g. Vite dev server on :5001), set this so user/auth API get JSON from the RFPSuite Express server (e.g. http://localhost:5000).
# VITE_RFPSUITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Stripe (admin buy credits). Secret key is server-only; never expose in the client.
# Set on the server (e.g. in your run environment or .env in project root):
#   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxx   (or sk_live_xxxx for production)
# Optional: base URL for Stripe Checkout redirect (success/cancel). Defaults to request origin.
#   APP_BASE_URL=https://your-app.com
